# Dailybbble

This project crawls [Dribbble][dribbble] continuously to keep record of popular
designs and archive them by day. It also offers them over an API, RSS and 
daily newsletters.


## Introduction

The web interface runs at [dailybbble.herokuapp.com][home]
on Heroku platform.

Crawler runs as an executable Python daemon at file `fetcher.py`. It runs
continuously to retrieve data from Dribbble. You can use `supervisor` to
keep this process alive.

In addition you can send daily/weekly emails newsletters by scheduling
cron jobs (one runs every morning, one every Saturday noon) with commands

    python -m dailybbble.emailer daily
    python -m dailybbble.emailer weekly

See notes below installing these tasks on Heroku Scheduler.


## Installation

Microsoft Azure Table Storage is used as database. Therefore you need to 
initialize enviornment variables

* `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`
* `AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
* `AZURE_TABLE_NAME` (where shots are going to be stored)

### 1. Deploying the fetcher

Build the Docker image:

    $ docker build -t dailybbble-fetcher -f Dockerfile-fetcher .

Run the container:

```
$ docker run -d --restart=always \
    -e AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME='<paste_account_here>' \
    -e AZURE_TABLE_NAME='dailybbble' \
    -e AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY='<paste_key_here>'
    --name dailybbble_crawler \
    dailybbble-fetcher
```

Check if it is running: `docker logs -f dailybbble_crawler`.

### 2. Deploying the server


In addition, for e-mail subscription the following environment variables
are needed from [SendGrid][sendgrid] service:

* `SENDGRID_USERNAME`: account or API user name as in [https://sendgrid.com/credentials](https://sendgrid.com/credentials)
* `SENDGRID_PASSWORD`: account password or API key
* `SENDGRID_LIST_NAMES`: comma separated names of 2 recipient lists for daily
and weekly subscriptions (better you don't use commas while creating list
names)
* `SENDGRID_SENDER_NAME`: identity name of registered sender

To disable email sending (for instance if you ran out of money recently
like I did), set environment variable:

* `DISABLE_EMAIL`: to `1` and it will be hidden from the UI.

For making use of `memcache` caching, configure the following
environment variables (auto-installed with Heroku Memcachier plugin):

* `MEMCACHIER_USERNAME`: SASL auth (if any)
* `MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD`: SASL auth (if any)
* `MEMCACHIER_SERVERS`: comma separated list of cache servers

You can use `$ heroku config:set KEY=VALUE` to persistently set environment
on Heroku app.


### Scheduling Emailer Tasks on Heroku

For using [Heroku Scheduler][heroku-scheduler] addon, here's the configuration:

    Daily emails: every day at 9 AM PST:
    Task: python -m dailybbble.emailer daily
    Frequency: Daily
    Next Run: 16:00 UTC

    Weekly emails: every Saturday at 11 AM PST:
    Task: ruby -e 'if Time.now.utc.wday != 6; exit 1; end' && python -m dailybbble.emailer weekly
    Frequency: Daily
    Next Run: 18:00 UTC

(To run scheduler dashboard, run `heroku addons:open scheduler`.)
